### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Key/Mouse inputs:

    C - Clear Splash Screen
    Enter - Begin Level
    Right Arrow Key - Move Paddle Right
    Left Arrow Key - Move Paddle Left

Cheat keys:

    R - Reset
    L - Extra Life
    S - Skip Level
    Space - Pause or Resume Game

Known Bugs:

    - successive block collisions that occur in a short span of time where blocks share a border sometimes look odd
    - ball behavior around the edges of the paddle sometimes causes ball to oscillate directions
    - paddle does not fully reach the wall every level

### Notes
    Power ups/downs  must be hit for the player to gain that power. I thought this was a better method than having the
    player catch the power because it makes it a little bit more difficult for the player to get the power.
    I was unable to implement all of my power ups and power downs in time. Sorry!
