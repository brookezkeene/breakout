Name: Brooke Keene (bzk2)

### Timeline

Start Date: September 3, 2018

Hours Spent: 40

### Resources Used

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: All images in resources folder

Key/Mouse inputs:

    C - Clear Splash Screen
    Enter - Begin Level
    Right Arrow Key - Move Paddle Right
    Left Arrow Key - Move Paddle Left

Cheat keys:

    R - Reset
    L - Extra Life
    S - Skip Level
    Space - Pause or Resume Game

Known Bugs:
    - successive block collisions that occur in a short span of time where blocks share a border sometimes look odd
    - ball behavior around the edges of the paddle sometimes causes ball to oscillate directions
    - paddle does not fully reach the wall every level

Extra credit:
    Power downs that increase your speed or freeze your paddle. I was not able to successfully implement all of these.

### Notes
    Power ups/downs  must be hit for the player to gain that power. I thought this was a better method than having the
    player catch the power because it makes it a little bit more difficult for the player to get the power.
    I was unable to implement all of my power ups and power downs in time. Sorry!

### Impressions
    Small parts of this project took much longer than I expected, such as making the bricks change their image after
    being hit by the ball. These are features that I normally take for granted in the games I play. Additionally finding
    the sources of some of my bugs, such as "ghost blocks" that my ball would recognize but did not appear on screen
    took a very long time.
